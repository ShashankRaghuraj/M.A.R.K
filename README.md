# M.A.R.K

M.A.R.K (My Artificial Response Kit) is an app created during the Tech Corps Camp. With the time alloted (1 day) I created a voice assistant that has the following capabilities
1) Getting the Date
2) Getting the Weather
3) Calculating numbers: It's very basic
4) Getting the News
5) Search up 

## API Usage

API's that were used were the:
- [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev)
  - Gets the current weather in my area
  - Doesn't work with new members however since I created a membership at the time, it still works 
- [Wolfram Alpha API](http://api.wolframalpha.com/)
  - Essential for the search algorithm
- [News API](https://newsapi.org/) 
  - Essential for getting the news which comes from ABC

These apis were crucial in making the app run at the time. The sole purpose of this app was to create something that would revolutionize the way people communicated with their surroundings. With more time, I could create an app that would be functional on ios and android.

#### Very short, and simple application. Hope you enjoy!
